## Authentication

Browser login requests `nansen:api` for API-key-equivalent account API permissions; existing OAuth/MCP `nansen:read` semantics and separate wallet authorization are unchanged.

Before any research command or loop, require an explicitly selected API key or saved browser session. Run `nansen auth status` first. Its cached/unverified metadata does not prove credential validity or unlocked storage. Cached access-token expiry alone does not mean the session is unusable: the CLI normally renews a selected session automatically during an already-authorized research task, without another consent request or a separate account check. Stop on anonymous selection, invalid authentication state, blocked or uncertain renewal/cleanup, or an actual authentication failure, including rejected or expired refresh authority. Follow the CLI error guidance; use the free `nansen account` check when troubleshooting calls for it. Do not unset a failed key, erase a session or switch to anonymous access to retry.

Use `nansen login` for fresh browser approval when server admission and the supported platform cohort are enabled, or configure a conventional API key. `NANSEN_API_KEY` overrides the saved session. OpenClaw's optional `primaryEnv` mapping preserves configured API-key injection; it is not a required-key gate or proof of authentication. Normal credits and entitlements apply. Login does not purchase credits. Browser rollout acceptance is still pending.

Anonymous x402 is a separate paid workflow: without a selected credential, the CLI can automatically spend funds from its configured wallet on a supported 402 challenge, once per call, including calls in loops. Do not run this research workflow anonymously. Anonymous payment requires separate explicit user intent and payment setup; it is never a fallback for failed authentication.

# DCA Watch

**Answers:** "What tokens are whales dollar-cost averaging into on Solana?"

```bash
nansen research smart-money dcas --limit 20
# → trader_address, trader_address_label, input/output_token_symbol, deposit_value_usd, dca_status, dca_created_at

# For each top DCA target, check token fundamentals
TARGET=<output_token_address>
nansen research token info --token $TARGET --chain solana
# → name, symbol, price, market_cap, token_details

nansen research token flow-intelligence --token $TARGET --chain solana
# → net_flow_usd per label: smart_trader, whale, exchange, fresh_wallets
```

To see DCA strategies targeting a specific token: `nansen research token jup-dca --token $TARGET`

DCAs show long-term conviction — SM DCA targets with positive smart_trader_net_flow = high-confidence accumulation.
